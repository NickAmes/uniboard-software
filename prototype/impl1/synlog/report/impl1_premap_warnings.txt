@W: MT529 :"/home/nick/Desktop/nickfolder/documents/projects/in-progress/project 5l - OSURC Rover 2016/electrical/uniboard/verilog/uniboard.sv":44:1:44:6|Found inferred clock UniboardTop|clk_20MHz which controls 56 sequential elements including uart_input.baud_gen.count\[11\]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
