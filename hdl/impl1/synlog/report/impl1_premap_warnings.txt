@W: MT531 :"/home/nick/Desktop/nickfolder/documents/projects/in-progress/project 5l - OSURC Rover 2016/electrical/uniboard/software/hdl/arm.sv":56:1:56:6|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 34 sequential elements including arm_x.read_value\[2\].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
