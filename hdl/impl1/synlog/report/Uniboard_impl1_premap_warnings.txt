@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"/home/nick/Desktop/nickfolder/documents/projects/in-progress/project 5l - OSURC Rover 2016/electrical/uniboard/software/hdl/clk.sv":14:1:14:6|Found inferred clock UniboardTop|clk_12MHz which controls 97 sequential elements including protocol_interface.uart_input.baud_gen.count\[3\]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
